# C Klib

CKlib is a gradle plugin that will build and package C/C++/Objective-C code for Kotlin/Native.

# Usage

Add gradle plugins

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("multiplatform")
    id("co.touchlab.cklib")
}
```

Add Kotlin version and define some C-like source:

```kotlin
cklib {
    config.kotlinVersion = KOTLIN_VERSION
    create("objcsample") {
        language = Language.OBJC
    }
}
```

See example in [Kermit](https://github.com/touchlab/Kermit/blob/main/kermit-crashlytics-test/build.gradle.kts#L69)

Configuring custom C Standard and llvmHome.
```kotlin
cklib {
    config.kotlinVersion = KOTLIN_VERSION
    config.llvmHome = "Absolute path to your local llvmHome version"
    create("csample") {
        language = Language.C
        cStandard = "gnu23"
    }
}
```

- Default `cStandard`: `gnu11`
- Default `cppStandard`: `c++17`

# Note

The main Kotlin project has changed how locally embedded C-like code is included in libraries. Use 
this project if you'd like, but outside of private projects we won't really be supporting it much.
